        "details": "There were many reasons behind this journey, but most of you know the primary one. Beyond that, this trip completely transformed my life. I was adopted by a family in Perumbakkam, introduced to me by a taxi driver named Saravanan Anna. I stayed at their house for a day, and the next day, I met Venkatase Iya. Saravanan Anna requested that I stay in their block, and they treated me like their own child. They didn't take even a single rupee from me and provided me with three meals a day for an entire month. I am deeply thankful to themâ€”Aravind, Akka, and their younger sister. I still wonder how I can ever repay their kindness. Afterward, I moved to Sivagangai district to meet my friend, Manikandan Anna. I began my journey with his younger brother, Neelakandan, and even met their father, an Ayurvedic doctor. I enjoyed temple festivals, bathing in the river, and experiencing the local culture. Feeling restless, I requested Manikandan Anna to help me find a job. Initially, he refused, but his Siththappa learned about my request and invited me to work in his shop in Coimbatore. I happily accepted and joined him there. Later, I realized I was drifting away from my true goals and decided I needed to either go home or settle in India with a job that aligned with my interests. Amazingly, I discovered that my motherâ€™s sister lived in Coimbatore. I left the shop job and stayed at her home, which became the third heaven in my life. I spent days visiting temples with my Anna and socializing with his Malayali friends. About my Annaâ€”he is truly a 'Coimbatore Singakkuddi.' While staying with my aunt, I told her I didnâ€™t want to return to Sri Lanka and asked her to help me find a job. I even offered to work at their OMG Restaurant. However, the next day, I received a call from my momâ€”a rather 'threatening' oneâ€”saying I had to return to Sri Lanka immediately. ðŸ˜„ My aunt suggested that I apply for postgraduate studies in Canada, as I could stay at her daughter's (my elder sisterâ€™s) home. I declined the offer, explaining that I wanted to stay in India and had no interest in going to Canada. With a heavy heart, I had to return to Sri Lanka, leaving behind a journey that shaped my life forever.",

Interestingly, although I had previously refused several scholarships, including a Russian scholarship, something inside me told me this was an opportunity I shouldnâ€™t miss. I decided to attend the interview. During the session, I was interviewed by Professor Malathy Ma'am and, I believe, Professor Vishnu Sir. I did my best to manage the interview, and it turned out to be a pivotal moment in my journey.",
