My mind was in a confussion that I am in love or not..... My mind was so derstubed. I did many things to come out from it but it worked only for few days. Finally on this day I got a chance to talk with her, I was looking her eyes deeply. Later I felt that all the feelings about her are being deleted in my physical memory. Ya this is true I can connect it with 'how the data in  chips can be deleted with passing UV rays'. I flet nothing in my mind and I was waving my hands and moved away from that place happily.<br><b><i>'Only after looking into her eyes and speaking did I realize that there was no connection between me and the love I had for her'.</i></b><br>Any how there is theory called though we delted the file, the traces/memory adress will not be deleted until it replaces by new data, this is how deleted files are recovered. The same way sometime my mind will try to recoever the past.",
